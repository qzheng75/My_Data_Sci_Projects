This smaller project is done when I'm learning various graphing techniques and linear regression. 
It's based on the dataset about housing price in California provided in the python sklearn module.
The project includes:
- Applying matplotlib.pyplot as a tool to create multiple types of graph
  - Demonstrating distrubution of data
  - Visualizing correlations between variables
- Apply linear regression to predict the price of a house based o given predictors
- Analyze the regression model by calculating its RMSE
